## Python Resources

With the growing popularity of the Python programming language for research, data science, and machine learning there has been a commensurate explosion of resources for learning Python programming. T

### Getting started with Python Programming

- [Official Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) - This is the primary source for learning about the language and all of the packages that are included in the standard library. The [Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) and [Library Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) are especially useful when learning to program in Python. The [Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html) is a bit technical but does a good job clarifying the precise terminology and  conceptual model that influences the design of the language.
- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) - This is another free, open access book that provides a gentle, but comprehensive introduction to the Python programming language. 
- [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/) - This is a free, open access book that introduces the Python programming language. The audience is researchers and folks who already have some experience with programming languages, but it is a nice resource because it introduces only the essential stuff you need to know to start being productive with Python. The book is also available on GitHub in the form of Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython).
- [Python For Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/book) - This is a free, open access book that introduces Python and computation. Written for librarians and information professionals. 


### Python Data Science


- [Official Pandas Documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - The [User Guide]() is a good place to start, but keep the [API Reference](http://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html) nearby at all times.
- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) - This is a free, open access book that is a great companion to the Whirlwind Tour of Python.


### Python for Digital Humanists

- [Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html) - This is a great resource and starting point for digital humanists who are interested in data analysis/cultural analytics. I have included this book in this GitHub repository.
- [Python for Digital Humanities](https://pythonhumanities.com/) - A comprehensive introduction to Python coding with a textbook, videos, and course materials.
