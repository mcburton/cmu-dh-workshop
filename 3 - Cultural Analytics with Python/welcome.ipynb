    "This book demonstrates how Python can be used to study cultural materials such as song lyrics, short stories, newspaper articles, tweets, Reddit posts, and film screenplays. It also introduces computational methods such as web scraping, APIs, topic modeling, Named Entity Recognition (NER), network analysis, and mapping.\n",

    "These materials were originally created to support \"Introduction to Cultural Analytics: Data, Computation & Culture,\" an undergraduate course taught at Cornell University and the University of Washington.\n",

    "**What is Cultural Analytics?**  \n",
    "Cultural analytics is the study of culture with computational methods. Culture is a broad term that includes literature, history, politics, art, music, social media, and a lot more. Cultural analytics is a growing research area in fields like [Digital Humanities](https://cmu-lib.github.io/dhlg/what-are-dh/) and [Information Science](https://infosci.cornell.edu/research). \n",
