    "We're going to install Python by installing [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/), a \"distribution\" that comes with basic Python as well as over [250 popular Python packages](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/py3.8_osx-64/) that are already pre-installed. These packages, sometimes called libraries, are collections of code written by other people for specific purposes. We can install and use them on top of basic Python. Anaconda includes packages such as *pandas* for data analysis, *matplotlib* for data visualization, and perhaps most importantly *JupyterLab* for interactive coding.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is also a package manager and environment manager. This functionality helps address a common problem that occurs when working with Python packages: when different versions of the same package conflict and break your code. If you're trying to use a tool that relies on an older version of *pandas*, for example, but you have the most upgraded version, it might break your tool. We won't spend a lot of time using Anaconda as a package manager and environment manager, but it's good to know that this functionality exists."
